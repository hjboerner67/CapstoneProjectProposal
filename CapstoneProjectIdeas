Question:  Are you preparing students for success in STEM related college programs and jobs

The idea of this program is to work with a local high school and assess the schools ability to prepare students for success in STEM related college programs and ultimately a successful career.  
This will be accomplished by analyzing government, college, and the selected high schools data.  Specifically, I would like to get an PCI compliant data set from the school
of all students that have graduated in the past 7-10 years.  What are the main schools that student target from that school.  I will work with administrator to determine the appropriate dataset, 
but I am primarily looking for the following data:

Student Data
1.  Random Number
2.  GraduationYear
3.  MaleFemale
4.  ClassesTaken
5.  ChosenPostSecondarySchool
6.  ACTScore
7.  SATScore

School Data
1.  AvialableCourses
2.  TargetedPostSecondarySchools

Based on the information provided, I will obtain key information from area post secondary institutions about their ability to provide STEM education to entering students.  This will be obtained by
utilizing the federal govenments college inventory dataset and then web scraping entrance criteria and STEM program graduation criteria.  I will also utilize the govenments occupation projection
database to corrolate need, projected salary, and hiring estimates.

The goal would be to give the high school a rating on STEM preparedness and recommendations on how to provide students with the option of programs that will prepare them for a career in STEM
related fields.
