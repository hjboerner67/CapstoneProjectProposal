Question:  Are you preparing students for success in STEM related college programs and jobs

The idea of this program is to work with a local high school and assess the schools ability to prepare students for success in STEM related college programs and ultimately a successful career.  
This will be accomplished by analyzing government, college, and the selected high schools data.  Specifically, I would like to get an PCI compliant data set from the school
of all students that have graduated in the past 7-10 years.  What are the main schools that student target from that school.  I will work with administrator to determine the appropriate dataset, but I am primarily looking for the following data:

Student Data
1.  Random Number
2.  GraduationYear
3.  Male/Female
4.  ClassesTaken
5.  ChosenPostSecondarySchool
6.  ACTScore
7.  SATScore

School Data
1.
